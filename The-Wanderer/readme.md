Translation is always a balance between staying faithful to the original, while making the translation accessable to the reader in the target language. When translating poetry there is the further difficulty of trying to retain the orignal poetic beauty. Even the most skilled translators must find a compromise, knowing that some part of the whole will be lost in translation. I chose to translate the poem line by line, even though the division into lines is not original to the poem. This keeps the meaning close to the original, but also makes the sentences more awkward to read. Nevertheless, I hope I have rendered them in a way that is not too difficult to read outloud because that is the way Anglo-Saxon poetry was intended to be enjoyed. Alliteration was another concern of mine in translation. The original Old English is richly alliterated. I did my best, but it fell short of my design.

This repository of the translation is for others to provide translation suggestions and even for translation into languages besides English. I know the people who would be most interested in this are not necessarily the most tech savy, but I thought it was worth putting it up here.

This translation is free for anyone to use.
